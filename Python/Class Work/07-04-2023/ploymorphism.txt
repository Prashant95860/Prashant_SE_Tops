polymorphism : one class derived properties of another class

	ploy means many and morphism means forms
	polymorphism which override method.

	there are 2 types of polymorphism
	1) method overloading
	2) method overriding

1) method overloading : one class have same name method but different arguments
2) method overriding : one or two class have same name properties

Note : python does not support method overloading.
